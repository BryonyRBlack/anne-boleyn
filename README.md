# Daily Life of Anne Boleyn
Daily Life of Anne Boleyn is a website that sends out a daily, weekly, or monthly email to the user about what happened to Anne Boleyn 500 years before. It also contains biographical information on Anne Boleyn, and a page containing all of the media apperances that include her as a character. 
The intended user base for this website is people who are interested in history, and wish to learn more about the Tudor period. There is a question on the form page about if users would be interested in other prominent Tudors, to see if there is a market for expansion.

# Features
## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is available in the same order on all pages to make for ease of navigation. On mobile it is under a burger icon so that it takes up less space and can be opened and closed as required. On larger screens it is fixed to the top to make for easy scrolling. It is the same colour as the header, except for which page is open, this is to ensure ease of navigation.

## Index Page

The index page is a simple page, with an image of Anne Boleyn, and a description of what the page's intent is and why. This includes the most famous painting of Anne, to be eyecatching.
## Footer

## About Anne page

The about Anne page is a brief overview of Anne's life. The first five sections are about Anne's life, with relevant images. On mobile the images are under the headers, whilst larger screens they are on the left. This was important to include as it gives users an idea on who Anne was and her importance to history.
## Children Section

The children section is part of the about page as it helps apply context to Anne's importance in history, including after her death. The information about Elizabeth also links into the question later on the form about if information about other Tudors would be of interest as it gives an example. 
## Map

## Media Page

The media page lists all of the actresses who have played Anne, including the name of the works and the year. This is so that if the user wishes to watch anything they have an easy place to find all of the onscreen portrayls of Anne.
## Video

The video is complete with controls so that the user can choose if they wish to interact or not. The video is of the West End/Broadway show portrayal of Anne.
## Form

The form takes the name and email address, and won't submit unless these are correctly input. It also asks how often the emails should be sent for the user's preference, as well as if they'd be interested in other Tudors, to see if expansion would be a useful feature to implant in the future.

Something something about showing relatives to ensure that webstructure made sense
Resposinve-ness. Main picture changes, layout for About Anne changes for pictures to be under header or next. Media page this changes for pictures to be 1, 2 or 3 columns depending on screen size.
