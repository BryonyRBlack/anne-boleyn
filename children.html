            <p>Born the 7th September 1533, Elizabeth is the only surviving child of Anne and Henry. At the time of her
                birth she was heir to the throne, however two years later her mother would be arrested, and executed.
            </p><br>
            <p>After her mother's execution, Elizabeth was removed from the line of succession, like Mary had been
                prior. It was until 1544 and Henry's marriage to Catherine Parr that both sisters were returned to the
                line of succession, after their brother Edward.</p><br>
            <p>When Henry died in 1547, Elizabeth resided with her step-mother Catherine Parr and her husband Thomas
                Seymour. Here it is believed that he sexually abused her. Although she was sent away in 1948, he
                continued his pursuit until his execution in 1549.</p><br>
            <p>Edward died in 1553, and though Jane Grey took the thorne for thirteen days, it was Mary who followed
                him. Her reign was a difficult time for Elizabeth as the two differed religiously.</p><br>
            <p>Mary died in 1558, and with no children, Elizabeth took the throne. Elizabeth never married, and died
                without heir, ending the Tudor reign.</p>
