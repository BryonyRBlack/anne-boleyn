            <p>Henry VIII is perhaps most famous for having six wives, and the famous rhyme "Divorced, Beheaded, Died,
                Divorced, Beheaded, Survived"</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Catherine of Aragon</span> - Henry's first wife, initially intended to marry his brother. When
                    she did not give birth to a son, Henry ended up divorcing her.</li>
                <li><span>Anne Boelyn</span></li>
                <li><span>Jane Seymor</span> - believed to be Henry's favourite wife. She is the mother of his only
                    legitimate son Edward, though died shortley after giving birth to him.</li>
                <li><span>Anna of Cleeves</span> - they were married for a very short time, and she was given the title
                    of beloved sister, and a palace after the divorce.</li>
                <li><span>Katherine Howard</span> - the youngest wife, being only 17 when they married. She was executed
                    due to accusations she was having an affair.</li>
                <li><span>Catherine Parr</span> - the surviving wife.</li>

            <p>Anne Boleyn and Henry only had one surviving child, Elizabeth. Although Henry wanted a son as an heir,
                Elizabeth became the longest ruling Tudor monarch. She did not have any children, and the throne went to
                the Stuarts.</p>
